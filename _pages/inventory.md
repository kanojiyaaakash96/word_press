<h2>INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h2>		
			<h2>Bill of Material(BOM)</h2>		
		<p>A bill of materials (BOM) is a comprehensive inventory of the raw materials,assemblies, subassemblies, parts and components, as well as the quantities of each, needed to manufacture a product.</p>		
			<h2>Purchase Orders</h2>		
		<p>Keep track of Purchase Orders alongside your assets. Automatically update items linked to Purchase Orders, and manage vendors and procurement costs all from one place.</p>		
			<h2>Production</h2>		
		<p>Production is the method of turning raw materials or inputs into finished goods or products in a manufacturing process. In other words, it means the creation of something from basic inputs.</p>		
			<h2>Sales</h2>		
		<p>A sale is a transaction between two or more parties, typically a buyer and a seller, in which goods or services are exchanged for money or other assets.</p>		
			<h2>Purchase & Sales Returns</h2>		
		<p>Goods purchased or sold being returned is quite a common practice in business. This may be on account of a number of reasons like defects in goods, quality not matching the requirement,the buyer not needing the stock, etc.</p>		
			<h2>Stock Adjustment</h2>		
		<p>Stock Adjustments can be used to update/correct the quantity and price of products in your Inventory. Adjustments could be required for entering new stock, removing damaged or stolen stock, data entry error and so on.</p>
